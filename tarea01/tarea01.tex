When you have some material, hit the “Typeset” button at the top left of the window. A dialog will appear asking you to save the document. When TEX typesets, it creates three or four additional files, so it is not a good idea to save directly to a location with many other files. Instead, put your source in a folder within such a location. To do that, navigate to a reasonable location, say ~/Documents, and then hit the “New Folder” button at the bottom of the dialog. Accept the default name or choose another and create the folder. Then name the document and save it. The default “Untitled” name will do
As soon as you save, TEX will typeset the document and open a second window showing the result.

Go back to the original window and add some additional text. Hit “Typeset” again. This time TEX immediately typesets the new material and updates the output window.

Now quit the program.
